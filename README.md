I bought a night light with a replaceable screw-in (C7) bulb, replaced the provided incandescent with a neon flame bulb, and found out the original lampshade would not fit over the new taller bulb.

This replacement shade is taller (74 mm) and open on the top rather than the back, and also has a decorative pattern of holes. It must be fitted to the night light before the bulb.

You will probably need to redesign the mounting section to fit your choice of night light base; the one I bought and designed this for does not appear to match the common design of “make your own night light” bases at all.

## Printing

No brim or supports are are required; the single overhang is designed for uncomplicated bridging.

The parameters as provided are set to provide a 2-extrusion-thick wall for 0.4 mm extrusion width; a single layer is also an option for more transparency at the expense of raggedness since every edge is then an extrusion start/stop point.
